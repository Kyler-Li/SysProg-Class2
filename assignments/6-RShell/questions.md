1. How does the remote client determine when a command's output is fully received from the server, and what techniques can be used to handle partial reads or ensure complete message transmission?

The remote client knows that a command's output is fully received when it detects a special end-of-message marker, such as RDSH_EOF_CHAR. The server appends this marker after sending the final part of the command output, allowing the client to recognize completion.

2. This week's lecture on TCP explains that it is a reliable stream protocol rather than a message-oriented one. Since TCP does not preserve message boundaries, how should a networked shell protocol define and detect the beginning and end of a command sent over a TCP connection? What challenges arise if this is not handled correctly?

A networked shell protocol must implement application-layer message framing to handle TCP's lack of message boundaries. 

3. Describe the general differences between stateful and stateless protocols.

Stateful Protocols can maintain session or connection state between client and server. Stateless Protocols has no memory of previous requests; each request is independent.

4. Our lecture this week stated that UDP is "unreliable". If that is the case, why would we ever use it?

UDP is considered "unreliable" because it does not guarantee message delivery, ordering, or error checking beyond a basic checksum.

5. What interface/abstraction is provided by the operating system to enable applications to use network communications?

The OS provides the Berkeley Sockets API (or simply sockets API) for network communication.
